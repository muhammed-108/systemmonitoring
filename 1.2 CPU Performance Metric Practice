1.2.1 Installing Lab Tools
Step 1 Install the system stress test tool stress.
[root@openEuler ~]# dnf config-manager --add-repo
https://repo.oepkgs.net/openeuler/rpm/openEuler-22.03-LTS/extras/x86_64/
[root@openEuler ~]# dnf -y install stress
Step 2 Install the thread stress test tool sysbench.
dnf -y install sysbench
Step 3 Install the system performance monitoring tool sysstat.
dnf -y install sysstat
1.2.2 Viewing CPU Usage
Step 1 Perform a CPU performance stress test.
[root@openEuler ~]# stress -c 2 -i 2 --timeout 300s &
[1] 6042
stress: info: [6042] dispatching hogs: 2 cpu, 2 io, 0 vm, 0 hdd


Step 2 View the CPU usage.
mpstat -P ALL 5 2 

Step 3 Check the CPU usage of each process.

ps aux --sort -&cpu

Step 4 Check the average system load.
[root@openEuler ~]# uptime
02:39:52 up 1:45, 2 users, load average: 0.02, 0.47, 0.44



1.2.3 Viewing Context Switches
Step 1 Perform a context switch stress test.
[root@openEuler ~]# sysbench --threads=4 --time=300 threads run &
[1] 6086
sysbench 1.0.20 (using system LuaJIT 2.1.0-beta3)
Running the test with following options:
Number of threads: 4
...

Step 2 Check system context switches.
vmstat 3 5 


Step 3 Check thread context switches.
In the multi-threaded scenario, the system load increases as the number of CPU context
switches per second reaches 3.2 million, accompanied by an increase in both voluntary
and involuntary task switches.
pidstat -w 5 2 -t | grep sysbench


Step 4 Check the average system load.
[root@openEuler ~]# uptime
03:14:46 up 2:20, 2 users, load average: 4.90, 3.12, 1.89
