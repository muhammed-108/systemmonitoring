1.6 top Performance Analysis Practice
The top command is a commonly used Linux performance analysis tool. It can display the
resource usage of each process in real time, similar to Task Manager on Windows. The
real-time system status view provides a summary of system information and a list of
processes or threads currently managed by the Linux kernel. The system summary
information and the type, order, and unit of process resources can be customized and
stored permanently.


1.6.1 Interactive Operations on the Main Interface
Step 1 View the system information on the main interface of top.
# top
The following information is displayed from top to bottom: system time and load, task
status, CPU usage, memory and virtual memory, and processes under the fields.

Step 2 Move the cursor.
Press the arrow keys to scroll and view fields and processes in the task area.

Step 3 Customize the main interface.
Key Function Key Function
j
Aligns texts to the
left or right. 
B
Toggles the bold text
mode.
J
Aligns numbers to
the left or right. 
z
Toggles between the
multicolor and
monochrome mode.

In this lab, numbers are left-aligned, texts are right-aligned, the multicolor mode is used,
and keywords are in bold.
Step 4 Adjust the information displayed in the summary area.
Press keys for interactive commands to display or hide information in the summary area
or adjust information display.
Key Function
l     Displays or hides the average system load.
t     Displays or hides task and CPU statistics, and adjusts the
display mode of CPU statistics.

m     Displays or hides memory information, and adjusts the display
mode of memory information.
1     Toggles between per-CPU usage and average CPU usage.


Step 5 Sort and modify fields in the task area.
Press f to go to the field management page. You can check the meaning of each field,
select required fields, and sort them.
Key Function Key Function
d    Shows or hides
a field.
s    Specifies the field by
which processes will
be sorted.
Right     Selects a field.
Left    Confirms the location of a field.
Up/Down   Adjusts the location of a field.
q     Exits the field management page.


(2) By default, processes in the task area are sorted in descending order based on the
selected field. You can press R to reverse the sorting order.



Step 6 Adjust the information displayed in the task area.

R
Sorts process in ascending
or descending order.

n
Sets the maximum number
of processes for display.
c
Displays process names or
startup commands. 
x
Toggles highlighting of the
sorting column.
V 
Toggles the tree view. 
y
Toggles highlighting of
running tasks.
< / > 
Switches the sorting field. 
H
Shows or hides thread
information.


In this lab, a maximum of five processes are displayed, the tree view is enabled to
visualize parent-child process relationships, and the sorting field and running processes
are highlighted.
Step 7 Save the configuration permanently.
Press W to save the modified configuration to a file. If the following information is
displayed, the configuration is successfully saved:
Wrote configuration to '/root/.config/procps/toprc'


1.7 Quiz
⚫ How do you adjust the frequency at which the system uses the swap space?
Answer: Adjust the swappiness and priority of the swap space.
⚫ What is the difference between buff and cache in memory performance metrics?
Answer: buff is used to reduce the number of I/O responses and handle excessive
resource accesses. cache is a compromise strategy used to handle speed mismatches and
accelerate accesses.
